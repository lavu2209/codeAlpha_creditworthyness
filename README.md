# 💳 Credit Scoring Model Using Machine Learning

This project builds a predictive model to assess the **creditworthiness** of individuals using historical financial data. The goal is to help financial institutions make data-driven lending decisions.

## 🧠Objective

To develop a classification model that accurately predicts whether a loan applicant will **default or repay** their loan based on key financial indicators.
